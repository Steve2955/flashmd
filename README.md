## About The Project

The aim of this project is to make learning easier, by providing you with the right toolset to convert your existing markdown notes without any modification into digital flashcards.
While learning you will be able to track your progress and learning efficiency is tried to be improved by [spaced repetition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition).

Currently this is just a small side-project of mine intended for personal use. But nevertheless I would like to  encourage everyone to support this project with ideas or code. Feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/Steve2955/flashmd/issues) anytime.
